"### Instruction: Write a response that gives the user an appropriate hint for the problem, 
    given the current state of their code. 

    The problem is: 
    merge-sorted-array
    
    Their code is: 
    class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n):
        """"""
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type m: int
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """"""

    ### Response: Letâ€™s first break down the known parameters. We have two lists (nums1, nums2) and two numbers (m, n) indicating the size of those lists. How can we use this information to iterate over the elements?

    ### Response: Now that you've created two loops, think of what you need to set as the iterating condition.
